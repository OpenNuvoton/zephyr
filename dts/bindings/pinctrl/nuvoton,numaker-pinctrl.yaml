    Pin controller is a singleton node responsible for controlling pin function 
    selection and pin properties. For example, for example you can
    use this node to set UART0 RX as pin PA0 to fulfill SYS_GPA_MFP0_PA0MFP_UART0_RXD.

    The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
    so you can modify it like this:

      &pinctrl {
              /* your modifications go here */
      };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as shown in this example:

      &pinctrl {
        /* configuration for the uart0 "default" state */
        uart0_default: uart0_default {
          /* group 0 */
          group0 {
            /* configure PA1 as UART0 TX and PA0 as UART0 RX */
            pinmux = <PA1MFP_UART0_TXD>, <PA0MFP_UART0_RXD>;
          };
        };


    To link pin configurations with a device, use a pinctrl-N property for some
    number N, like this example you could place in your board's DTS file:

       #include "board-pinctrl.dtsi"

       &uart0 {
             pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_default>;
             pinctrl-names = "default";
       };
